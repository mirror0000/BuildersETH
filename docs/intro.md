# Tutorials Overview

## Solidity

**Our primary focus will be on Solidity.**

The goal is to:

- give an in-depth look into the language's primitives.
- progress to show patterns often used in the web3 industry.
- jump into deep dives around Solidity-based applications.
- give the reader the proper context on when and where to use these tools.
- Finally, relate to real-world projects which use these tools.

As time progresses, we will increase the scope of our studies to other tools in web3. However, for focus, we will keep our attention on Solidity and its emerging patterns.

## Side Quests: Math

Occasionally there will be some entries in the math section around Set Theory. The aim will be to build up the necessary knowledge to engage with Game Theory and later Mechanism Design. The goal is for these two tracks to converge, having robust proofs that can be ported over to Solidity code.

When this happens is not known. But there are no royal roads to math. We will just have to take it a day at a time.

## Considerations

Consider this more of a series of study notes than a definitive guide. However, the aim is to challenge the author and the reader to understand this new paradigm. It is a paradigm shift that will affect all forms of social coordination: money, social organizations, culture, and identity itself.
