# Set Theory Introduction

<!-- create component to highlight things  -->

import Highlight from "../../src/components/Highlight";

**Aim**: We aim to become familiar with the language of mathematics.
In doing so, we can study and apply the fields of Game Theory, Mechanism Design, Statistics, and Causality
to the area of crypto-economics.

We wish to marry mathematical rigor to smart contract programming in an open and accessible way.
All that is required is persistence, patience, and a sense of humor. There are no royal roads to mathematics.
However, we can have some fun stops along the way.

We posit that this could unleash a new wave of innovation and serve as kindling to new forms of human collaboration.
In all, we wish to preserve the freedom of the individual and unleash their creative potential.
Let us work towards a more prosperous and free society for everyone together.

Let's begin.

For now this is a placeholder.

## Some Math Notation

$$
\Huge \color{#aa0A17} \Reals \color{blue} \exists \color{green} \forall
$$

Red = Set of all real numbers.  
blue = exists  
green = for all

Let $\color{blue}f\lbrace[a,b]\rbrace\color{green}\to\color{red}\R$ be something.

<Highlight color="blue">
  The product of two numbers{" "}
</Highlight> <Highlight color="green">is part of the</Highlight> <Highlight color="red">
  set of real numbers{" "}
