# Introduction to Solidity Smart Contracts

## Smart Contract History

Smart contracts are scripts that run on programmable blockchains. For Ethereum based blockchains, the primary language is called Solidity.

Think of smart contracts, or contracts for short, as classes in another object oriented language. However, why are they called contracts?

The idea of [smart contracts came from Nick Szabo](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-idea-of-smart-contracts/) in 1997. [Szabo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FA3UjA0igY) strived to combine law and computation to advance the goals of the [cypherpunks](https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/), a movement of computer enthsaists who aimed to leverage [public key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) to advance human freedoms. This will be covered in a future blog post.
