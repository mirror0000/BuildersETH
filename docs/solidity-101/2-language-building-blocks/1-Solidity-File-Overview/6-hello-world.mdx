# Hello, World!

`Hello World!` is usually the first program we write when learning a new programming language.

This simple contract contains a few concepts:

- `pragma`
- comments
- licenses
- `contract`

We will go into each of these in-depth later.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="sol" label="HelloWorld.sol">

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// compiler version must be greater than or equal to 0.8.13 and less than 0.9.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract HelloWorld {
    string public greetings = "Hello World!";
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## File extension

This program is called: `HelloWorld.sol`. Solidity files, called contracts, end with the `.sol` extension.

# Nameing Conventions

Solidity contracts follow the PascalCase convention: the first letter capitalized, followed by each word.

An exception is if the file is based on an acronym.

`SampleFile.sol`  
`ERC20.sol`  
`MyToken.sol`

## Comments

Comments function similar to JavaScript.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="sol" label="Comments.sol">

```solidity
// this is a single line comment

/* this is a

multi line comment
*/
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Pragma - Define The Solidity Compiler Type

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.13;
```

`pragma` specifies the compiler verson of Solidity.

## License

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

Every contract needs to specify the license which supports it.

Licensing is essential because it stipulates how you can use a piece of code. Much of the open source software movement is based on legal innovations on very permissive licenses like [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) and [GPL-3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).

## Contract Keyword

```solidity
contract HelloWorld { ... }
```

Solidity is an object-oriented language. This means that it uses something like classes to structure information. For example, you can think of the keyword `Contract` as similar to the `class` keyword in other programming languages like C, Java, or JavaScript.

## Variables

```solidity
string public greetings = "Hello World!";
```

Variables in Solidity are different than JavaScript. One of the differences is the need to define their data type and visibility up front.

Data type represents the type of data. This reduces errors related to adding incorrect data types to variables. Visibility focuses on who can access the data.
