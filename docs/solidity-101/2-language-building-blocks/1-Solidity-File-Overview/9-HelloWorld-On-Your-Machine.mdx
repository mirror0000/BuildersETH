# HelloWorld.sol on Your Machine

Let's create our `HelloWorld.sol` to a local development environment on our machine.

## Setting Up Development Enivronment

**Split into new file - Your first smart contract**

First, let's create a new directory. Navigate to where you want to place your code and create a new directory, aka folder.

`mkdir web3CryptoDev`
`1-storageContract`

Now lets create the project scaffold:
`truffle init`

Inside our newly created project we find a few files:

```
.
├── contracts
│   └── Migrations.sol
├── migrations
│   └── 1_initial_migration.js
├── test
└── truffle-config.js
```

### Directory Description

#### Contracts

`contracts` directory is where your smart contracts are stored.

The default file is the `Migratons.sol`, which keeps a history of previously run migrations that is recorded on-chain.

#### Migrations

`migrations` directory files that helps you help you deploy contracts to the Ethereum network. Migration files are simply a set of managed deployment scripts. All the migrations located in this will run in the order listed, from 1 to N.

The first script is `1_initial_migration.js` and is for the `Migration.sol`. In truffle, contract usually has its own migration script.

So, `Apple.sol` would have `n-apple.sol` with `n` being the order you'd like to deploy it.

We will learn more about migrations later.

#### Test

`test` folder holds our tests. Testing is EXTREMELY important in smart contract development, because they are technically immutable and can hold large sums of value. Along with testing [**fuzzing**](https://consensys.net/diligence/scribble/) is also a best practice.

We will cover these topics later.

#### truffle.config.js

This holds the configuration for our project. Here we can customize the networks, network providers, and other things.

You can learn more about [truffle.config.js here](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration/). We will be covering this later.
