# Number Sizes

The table below shows the built-in integer types in Solidity.

| Length        | Signed | Unsigned |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- |
| 8-bit         | int8   | uint8    |
| 16-bit        | int16  | uint16   |
| 32-bit        | int32  | uint32   |
| 64-bit        | int64  | uint64   |
| 128-bit       | int128 | uint128  |
| 256-bit       | int256 | uint256  |
| 256-bit alias | int    | uint     |

Like uint, different ranges are available from int8 to int256

int256 ranges from -2 ** 255 to 2 ** 255 - 1
int128 ranges from -2 ** 127 to 2 ** 127 - 1

different sizes are available  
uint8 ranges from 0 to 2 ** 8 - 1  
uint16 ranges from 0 to 2 ** 16 - 1  
...  
uint256 ranges from 0 to 2 \*\* 256 - 1
