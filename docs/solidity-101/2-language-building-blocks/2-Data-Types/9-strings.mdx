# Strings

Strings are a sequence of characters, either as a [literal constant](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_(computer_programming)>) or as some kind of variable.

In both Solidity and JavaScript, strings are immtuable. The word `"Hello"` is fixed. If you change it to `"Hello World"` is a totally different word.

### String escape characters

There are escape characters as well. Note the capital letter `N` is a stand in, and can represent any character as defined in the description.

With the exception of [hexadecimal represenation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Numbers_and_dates#hexadecimal_numbers), these are all the same in JavaScript.

[Hexcadecimal values](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/hexadecimal) are base-16 number systems running from 0-9 and A-F. You probably have seen them while using CSS.
