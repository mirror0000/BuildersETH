# Introduction: Data Types

## Primitive Data Types Overview

In a high-level programming language, a primitive data type is the simplest building block for data. They are data types that cannot be reduced into a simpler form. Primary data types are the building blocks for other data types.

Usually, these at least include:

- certain types of number representations
- strings for character representation
- Booleans for true or false representation

## Value Types Defined

This section will cover **value types**.

A value type:

- is the actual value.
- stores its data directly on the memory it owns.
- **passes by value** aka, the variable's values are **copied** when they are used as function arguments or in assignments. These copies don't affect the original data.

These are different from **reference types**.

Reference types:

- [references](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)>) data at another location, aka it [points](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)>) to another spot.

We will cover reference types and memory in the following lessons.

## Structing Data in Context

Why are these important? To write a program, you must define the type of data you will store and manipulate. For example, will you hold numbers, words, a collections of these, or some custom data type etc.?

A significant part of understanding how to design and code programs centers around:

- understanding which types of data you'd want to manipulate.
- and how to manipulate that data.

Once our data is structured correctly, algorithms are used to manipulate the data. **Algorithms** are a series of instructions to solve a specific type of problem efficiently. It's worth noting that certain types of problems are best solved with particular data types and algorithms. The study of this is covered in a course on data structure and algorithms.

Furthermore, certain recurring business logic problems are best solved with repeatable patterns. These best practices are called **design patterns**, and their application to web3 development will be covered in the future.
