# Introduction

## Summary

Solidity offers a variety of data types, such as addresses, uints, bytes, strings, etc.

Structs are a great way to store different data types together. You can think of a struct as an improved array, because regular arrays in Solidity only allow 1 data type.

## Example

We use the sample contract from our Storage Box smart contract, but we add a `struct` called `DataStruct` (mind the capital D):

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity 0.8.13;

contract SimpleStorage {
    
    struct DataStruct {
        uint storedData;
        string message;
    }

    DataStruct data; //assign a name to the struct

    function setStruct(uint _storedData, string memory _message) public { //our function now has 2 parameters
       data = DataStruct(_storedData, _message); //push data to the DataStruct
    }

    function getDataStructMessage() public view returns (string memory) {
        return data.message; //returns the string message from struct DataStruct
    }

    function getDataStructNumber() public view returns (uint) {
        return data.storedData; //returns the uint storedData from struct DataStruct
    }
}
```

## Accessing the struct data

In order to access the data inside the struct, we need to use the access operator `.`, like so: `structName.member`.<br />

In our contract code, we used the structName `DataStruct`. The member name for the uint was `storedData`. The function `getDataStructNumber` was able to access and return the uint, because we used the . operator: `return data.storedData;`.
