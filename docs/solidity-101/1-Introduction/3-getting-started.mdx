# Getting Started: Installation

Let’s start your Web3 journey with Solidity! Every journey starts somewhere!

In this section, we’ll discuss:

- Installing a development environment on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Writing a program that prints `Hello, world!`.

## Installation Pre-requisites

Install the following tools:

1. [NodeJS and Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation/). Follow the instructions to get both. Use Node 14 and up.
2. [Ganache CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache#readme), a command line based local blockchain.
3. [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/), the same local blockchain, but with a the graphic user interface.
4. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), a text editor.
5. [Truffle VS Code Extension](https://trufflesuite.com/blog/build-on-web3-with-truffle-vs-code-extension/). Truffle in your VS Code Editor!
6. [Solidity Linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) The Ethereum Solidity Language for Visual Studio Code by [Juan Blanco](https://twitter.com/juanfranblanco?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). Give him a follow.

For Windows users:

1. Set up [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Configure [VS Code for Bash](https://www.shanebart.com/set-default-vscode-terminal/).

## Assumptions

We assume that you have:

- at least 6 months to 1 year programming experience with familarity with [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).
- some [command line experience](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).
