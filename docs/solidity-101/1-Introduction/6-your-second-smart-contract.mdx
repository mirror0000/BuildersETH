# Your Second Smart Contract

Let’s jump into Solidity by building a hands-on project together! This section introduces you to a few common Solidity concepts by showing you how to use them in a real program.

You’ll get an brief overview of:

- variable types
- constructors
- functions
- control flow
- setting up your development environment
- using truffle boxes
- and and more!

In the following sections, we’ll explore these concepts in more detail. In this section, you’ll practice the fundamentals hands on.

Let's create a classic beginner program: a guessing game. The smart contract will generate a "random" integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit

We will implement a naive approach first. Then we will discuss why this can be improved and introduce a more sophiticated and tamper proof method.

That's it!

## Hello World!

Now that you’ve installed the development environment, let’s write your second Solidity program. It’s traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that prints the text Hello, world! to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!
