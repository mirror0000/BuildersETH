# Variables Types Overview

## Variables Overview

Variables allow us to:

- Store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.
- Label a data type with a descriptive name.
- Specify under what conditions the data can be changed.
- Specify the type of data that can be held.

The variable's data is then used throughout your program. Variables make our programs more easily understood and clearer to your future self and other developers.

Think of variables like boxes that hold information, and your program is like a large warehouse. Imagine trying to keep organized a whole warehouse of things without boxes or labels!

Solidity has three different types of variable types. **The difference between each is in your ability can edit them after creation**:

- Mutable variable
- `const`
- `immutable`

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract VariablesOverview {
    // type, scope, variable name
    string public my_name;
    string public constant EXISTS = true;
    string public immutable BIRTH_MONTH;

    // set instructions
    constructor(uint _birth_month) {
        uint BIRTH_MONTH = _birth_month;
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
contract VariablesOverview {
    let my_name;
    const EXISTS = true;
    const BIRTH_MONTH;  // immutable don't exist in JavaScript

    // set instructions
    constructor(_birth_month) {
        BIRTH_MONTH = _birth_month;
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Mutable variables

Unlike JavaScript, Solidity doesn't have a `let` keyword to express that a variable can be updated with another value later. Instead, its **mutability** is implied. Mutability is the ability to change, delete or update a piece of data. Think of it as being able to change what's inside of our labeled box in storage.

For a mutable variable, we declare:

- the data type
- the scope
- the variable's name

We will cover data types and scope in the following two lessons.

<TabItem value="sol" label="Solidity">

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract VariablesOverview {
    // type, scope, variable name
    string public my_name;
   // ...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
class VariablesOverview {
    let myName = '';
    // ...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Since Solidity is statically typed language, any variable updates MUST be of the same type as the variable declared. This is different to JavaScript, a dynamically-typed languages, where the varible's value is at assigned at runtime based on the current value.

A [**runtime**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3900549/what-is-runtime) is software executed while your program is running. This includes instructions that you did not write, but are necessary to run your code properly.

A compiler is a piece of software that translates code from a higher-level language to a lower-level language. In Solidity's case, our human-readable code is translated to EVM bytecode. We will have an overview of Ethereum's compiler in a future post.

## `const`

**CHANGE THIS**

Like JavaScript, Solidity does have constant variables. Constants are variables that cannot be modified.

Their value is hard coded. Just like JavaScript, the coding convention (aka best practice) is to captialize the variable and use underscores to seperate words.

Another benifit of constants is that they can save gas costs. We will cover gas in a future post.

## `immutable`

`immutable` variables are like constants (`const`). `immutable` variable values can be set inside the `constructor` function but cannot be **modified** afterward.

What is a constructor? Briefly, a constructor allows you to set or pass in the default parameters of a contract. For example, using an `immutable` gives you the:

- flexibility to customize the initial start conditions for a contract.
- guarantee that these cannot be updated.

We will cover `constructor` in much more depth later.

In JavaScript, there is no `immutable` primitive type. However, there are libraries which can help emulate immutability like [ImmutableJS](https://immutable-js.com/).

### `immutable` Example Code

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="sol" label="Solidity">

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Immutable {
    // coding convention to uppercase constant variables
    uint public immutable MY_UINT;

    constructor(uint _myUint) {
        MY_ADDRESS = msg.sender;
        MY_UINT = _myUint;
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To create the contract, we pass in the initial values for the constructor, which sets our immutable values.
