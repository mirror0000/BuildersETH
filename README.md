# Web3CryptoDev

Learn Web3 development from Zero to Mastery.

Our goal is to create a running series covering Solidity and all things Web3 development.

As a result of this, we will connect devs to devs and build a community around building, innovation and mutual help.

See the website:
[web3cryptodev.com](https://www.web3cryptodev.com/)

## Our mission

**Easy to use**  
Designed with open source contributions from people like you! Our community aims to teach developers how to quickly learn and apply web3 development skills.

**Focus on What Matters**  
Focus on what matters. Explore what real web3 developers do day to day. Go beyond "Hello World" tutorials. Go deeper and explore the depths of web3. We combine theory with real-world examples.

**Powered by the Commmunity**  
Leverage our collective knowledge. Strive to make one small contribution. The sum is greater than the whole!

**Ship, ship, ship**  
Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Shipping and improving via iterations is preferable to analysis paralysis.

## The Approach

Move fast and break things. Content will be written and published quickly every weekday. Then we will solicit community feedback through [issues](https://github.com/tesla809/BuildersETH) and [pull requests](https://github.com/tesla809/BuildersETH/pulls) for fixes.

The work is **NOT** perfect. Most of it needs heavy proofreading and will be edited over time.

**The process will be:**  
Build -> Write -> Publish -> Edit in public

## Contributions Wanted

Have a topic youâ€™d like to contribute or want to learn about? Feel free to open an issue:

Any and all feedback is appreciated <3!

## Boilerplate

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
